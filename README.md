# fcc-python-scicomp

This repo contains the project resolution files I submitted to complete the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

In each file there is a link to the project description in **freeCodeCamp** and another one to my [Replit](https://replit.com/@ToniG4) page where each project can be executed with the test already provided in the project template.
